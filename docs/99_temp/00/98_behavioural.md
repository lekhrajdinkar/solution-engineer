## 13. Team hard to work on
- I generally work well with most teams, but I find it difficult when working with teams that lack transparency or ownership. 
- it can create delays and confusion.
- I try to resolve it by initiating regular syncs
- and encouraging open communication.
- learned : proactively reaching out and aligning early to avoid miscommunication.

## 12. Conflict in team
| **STAR Element** | **Response**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **‚úîÔ∏è Situation** | I was working on a project to publish SWIFT messages to a downstream vendor, who would forward them to a transfer agent or customer agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Task**      | We needed to define how to transfer these messages from our app to an external gateway. My colleague proposed using an **MFT (Managed File Transfer)** connection, while I suggested using a **message broker** for real-time publishing.                                                                                                                               |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Action**    | Instead of pushing my approach directly, I proposed we **list pros and cons** of both options (latency, security, supportability). We involved an architect for a third opinion and aligned on key non-functional requirements.<br>Eventually, we agreed on **message broker** for real-time, reliable delivery and added a **fallback file-based solution** as backup. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Result**    | - The system became faster and more reliable.<br>- Both sides felt heard and respected.<br>- I learned that **conflicts can be healthy** if handled with open discussion, data, and empathy.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## 11. short term sacrifice for long term gain
- created CIAM dashboard
- removed hardcoding so many thing.
- created config table. perform datamod with doing release in prod.

## 10. Approach if two clients requesting two different features?
| **Step**                      | **Approach**                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **Understand impact**       | - Talk to both clients to understand **business value**, **urgency**, and **use cases**<br>- Check if features are **blocking revenue**, **compliance**, or **key workflows** |
| ‚úÖ **Evaluate effort**         | - Estimate time, complexity, team availability, and dependencies for both requests                                                                                            |
| ‚úÖ **Communicate clearly**     | - Be transparent with both clients about **priority, ETA**, and reasoning                                                                                                     |


## 9. calculated risk
- share_qty | t+2
- UMC : quick fix - added feature to stage file and update it then release it 
    - created endpoints to stage and manually publish.
    - Documented steps. since  manual steps so risk

| **‚úîÔ∏è Situation** | We had a batch job system that processed customer data overnight. It was slow, hard to debug, and frequently failed. Performance degradation became a concern as data volume grew.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Task**      | I was asked to improve performance and reliability without a full rewrite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Action**    | - Investigated the PySpark code and found the **main bottleneck was excessive data shuffling** due to wide transformations (like `groupBy` and `join`) on large datasets.<br>- Refactored the job by **optimizing partitioning**, reducing wide transformations, and using `broadcast joins` where applicable.<br>- Rewrote the pipeline using **modular PySpark on AWS Glue**, and replaced manual shell-based triggers with **event-driven Lambda** orchestration.<br>- Added **CloudWatch logs and alerts** for observability. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Result**    | - **Job runtime reduced by \~50%**<br>- **Failure rate dropped significantly**<br>- The pipeline became **easier to maintain and debug**<br>- Business gained **faster and more reliable data processing**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ShufflingExample").getOrCreate()

# Large dataset A
df_large = spark.read.csv("s3://bucket/large_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
# Medium dataset B
df_medium = spark.read.csv("s3://bucket/medium_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
# This join will cause a shuffle across the cluster
joined_df = df_large.join(df_medium, on="customer_id")
# Followed by groupBy - another shuffle
result = joined_df.groupBy("region").count()
result.show()


# Hint Spark to use broadcast join to avoid shuffle
joined_df = df_large.join(broadcast(df_medium), on="customer_id") # üëàüèª

# Repartition by region to optimize groupBy
df_partitioned = joined_df.repartition("region") # üëàüèª
# Aggregation now happens within partition

| **Problem**                     | **Fix**                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Large shuffle on join           | Use `broadcast()` on smaller dataset   |
| Shuffle due to groupBy          | Use `.repartition()` by the group key  |
| Inefficient wide transformation | Reduce or chain narrow transformations |

| ‚úîÔ∏è **Situation** | In our production environment, SNS alerts were intermittently failing, and business users were not receiving critical email notifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ‚úîÔ∏è **Task**      | I needed to identify the root cause and implement a reliable, long-term solution to ensure alert delivery regardless of network issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ‚úîÔ∏è **Action**    | Through investigation, I found the failures occurred during firewall updates that blocked outbound internet traffic. Since SNS used public endpoints, the service was unreachable. I resolved this by configuring a **VPC endpoint for SNS**, enabling private communication via AWS‚Äôs internal network. I also tested the solution under simulated outage conditions. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è **Result**    | After the change, SNS alerts became consistently reliable, even during firewall updates. This restored business confidence, improved system reliability, and reduced incident escalations.                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **‚úîÔ∏è Situation** | We worked on modernizing a legacy TACT system, which was monolithic, hard to scale, tightly coupled, and had frequent performance and stability issues. It ran only on mainframes.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Task**      | I was responsible for building the **interface module**, which had:<br>üî∏ **Inbound module** ‚Äî data pipeline to process small CSV files from S3 (used PySpark)<br>üî∏ **Outbound module** ‚Äî event-driven microservices using SQS, EventBridge, SNS, Lambda, Java/Python APIs, and RDBMS schema design                                                                      |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Action**    | - Developed **stateless REST APIs** using Java/Python + Spring Boot<br>- Built **event-driven architecture** using SQS, EventBridge, and Lambda<br>- Implemented **distributed tracing** using OpenTelemetry and X-Ray<br>- Used **Aurora Serverless** with read replicas for performance<br>- Set up **DR strategy** and automated deployments using Terraform + Harness |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Result**    | The system became scalable, observable, and cloud-native. It improved my skills in **system design**, **AWS architecture**, and **cross-team collaboration**.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **‚úîÔ∏è Situation** | I was part of a large Angular upgrade project focused on front-end development ‚Äî rendering JSON responses per UX designs. After go-live, all 18 offshore back-end API developers were released.                                                                                  |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Task**      | My manager expected me to support both front-end and back-end, including batch jobs and production issues ‚Äî despite having no prior exposure to the back-end systems.                                                                                                            |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Action**    | - I respectfully explained the knowledge gap to my manager<br>- Suggested retaining a few API developers temporarily until things stabilized<br>- Documented every issue I encountered<br>- Proactively started learning key back-end flows using logs and limited system access |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Result**    | - My manager appreciated my transparency<br>- Temporary backend support was re-engaged<br>- I managed the situation without escalation<br>- Learned the value of **clarifying expectations early** and being proactive in tough situations                                       |
