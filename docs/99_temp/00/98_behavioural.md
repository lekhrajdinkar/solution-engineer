## You took something out your area of responsibility
```
✔️Situation:
In my current project, we have an onshore QA lead who occasionally takes extended vacations.

✔️Task:
During his absence, there’s a gap in coordination between the onshore team and the offshore QA members
which could impact release timelines and quality.

✔️Action:
To ensure continuity, I voluntarily step in to backfill his role. 
I take over coordination duties, lead the offshore QA team, manage test cycles, clarify requirements,
and serve as the bridge between the developers and testers.

I also help "prioritize" bugs and ensure proper test coverage during sprints.

✔️Result:
This proactive involvement has helped maintain smooth releases 
and strong collaboration between development and QA teams. 
It also built trust with stakeholders and showed my flexibility in supporting cross-functional areas
beyond my core engineering role.

## learn something new
```
“My approach to learning something new depends on the type of technology.

✔️If I’m learning a new programming language, 
I usually start by comparing it to languages I already know like Java, Python, and TypeScript.
I look at syntax differences, core concepts like memory management or typing, 
and try to understand how the language handles common patterns.

✔️For a new framework or library, 
I first try to understand what problem it solves. 
Most frameworks introduce an abstraction to simplify complexity,
 so I explore what's under the hood

✔️I also prefer to learn in a structured and focused way.
 There’s a lot of content online — blogs, videos, newsletters — 
 so I try to avoid information overload by choosing 1–2 high-quality resources and sticking with them.

✔️Once I get the fundamentals, I shift to learning by doing 
 building small projects or proof of concepts.
 I believe "discipline" is key, so I set aside dedicated time regularly to go deep and "reinforce" what I learn.”
 practice and apply.
```

## project most proud of 
```
MAPS, where we modernized a legacy TACT with modern solutions with Cloud.

✔️Situation: The legacy system was hard to scale, error-prone, performance issue, tighlty coupled, only MF.

✔️Task: responsible for interface module 
inbound module
    - Data pipeline to process small scale CSV file from S3 bucket. learnt pyspark.
outbound module
    - event driven microservice with sqs, event bus, sns and lambda.
    - java and python restful api
    - RDBMS design

✔️Action: 
    used Java/python and Spring Boot to build stateless APIs, 
    implemented distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry/x-rays
    and optimized performance with AWS Aurora Serverless + read replicas
    DR plan
    deployment automation using Terraform and harness

✔️Result: This project also helped me grow in system design and cross-team collaboration.

## Conflict  with manager
```
I was part of a large Angular upgrade project, 
and my role focused on front-end development—mainly 
rendering JSON responses according to UX designs. 

Toward the end of the project, all 18 offshore back-end API developers were released. 
At that point, my manager expected me to support both the front-end and back-end, 
including batch jobs and production issues.

I realized that I didn’t have enough knowledge of the back-end systems or batch workflows, 
as I hadn’t worked on those during the project. 
I 🔸respectfully brought this up with my manager, 
explained the gap, and suggested that we retain 
few API developers until the application stabilized.

While the situation was stressful, I focused on documenting all the issues 
I encountered and started learning key back-end components from logs and limited access. 
My manager appreciated the transparency, 
and eventually we got some temporary support re-engaged. 

I learned how important it is to clarify expectations early.

✔️Present (Who you are now)
I’m a software engineer with 12 years of experience building 
scalable backend services and distributed systems using Java, py, Spring Boot, angular
AWS and RBDMS and k8s/EKS

✔️Past (Where you’ve been)
I started my career in Infosys, working on enterprise apps,
and then transitioned to cloud-native/cloud first development. 
Migration/tect-debt project
I've led projects involving AWS Aurora Serverless, Lambda, and microservices architecture.

✔️Skills/Strengths (What you bring)
I have a strong background in system design, microservices, and observability. 
Recently, I’ve also been working on kafka integration.

✔️Future (Why you're here / what you’re looking for)
Now I’m looking for a role where I can contribute to high-scale architecture decisions
while continuing to grow in cloud-native engineering and GenAI applications
