## container-d
- K8s initially supports docker runtime only (cli,api,build, volumne, auth, security, **runtime/container-d**)
- Afterward supports different Runtime/s via `CRI` - OCI-standard imageSpec and ContainerSpec
  - OCI - Open Container Interface.
  - Any image follows OCI/imageSpec is supported by k8s
  - Any Container follows OCI/ContainerSpec is support
  - runtime:
    - rkt
    - docker ( supported via `dockershim`)
  - v1.24 
    - `dockershim` removed 
    - docker is removed k8s
  - so, `container-d` is runtime for docker as per OCI/ContainerSpec for kubernetes.
    - now standalone project under CNCF
    - needed only runtime, no other feature, then install it.
