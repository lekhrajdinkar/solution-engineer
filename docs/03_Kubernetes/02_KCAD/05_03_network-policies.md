- cluster has VPC span across nodes.
    - by default all traffic `allow` b/w ALL pods, services.
    - can add restriction with **n/w policy**.
    - pod, services  === VM, has IP:port in VPC.

- policy:
    - in rule added to allow incoming traffice, then default respomse out is allowed.
    - And don't add separate egress rule.
    - eg: DB-pod <---allow---- API-pod. good. enough
    - yml definition:
      - ingress --> from : cidr block, other pod of ns-1, etc
