- Concept of a long-running, interconnected sequence of operations, like a "saga" in storytelling
- data consistency without relying on traditional ACID transactions (which are impractical in distributed systems).
- steps:
    - Breaks a transaction into smaller, local steps.
    - uses compensating actions (rollback logic) if a step fails.
    - eg: E-Commerce Order
```text
    Step 1: Reserve inventory ‚Üí Step 2: Charge payment ‚Üí Step 3: Ship order.
    If payment fails: Trigger compensation ‚Üí "Release inventory" + "Notify user."
```
```text
Purpose: 
Manage distributed transactions across multiple services.

Implementation:
Choreography-Based: Each service emits events to trigger the next step.
Orchestration-Based: A central coordinator manages the transaction flow.
Implement compensation actions for rollback (e.g., CancelOrder, RefundPayment).

Use Case: 
Order processing in e-commerce (inventory, payment, shipping services).
