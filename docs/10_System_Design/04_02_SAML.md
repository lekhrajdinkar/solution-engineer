## concept
- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):
- A protocol primarily used for Single Sign-On (SSO) **authentication**.
- Allows users to log in once and access multiple services without re-authenticating.
- Commonly used in enterprise environments.
- **browser-based single sign-on**
- It allows identity providers (IdPs) like Okta to authenticate users and pass their identity to Saas, AWS, etc
- **Okta** simplifies SAML setup via pre-built integrations with many SPs. ⬅️
