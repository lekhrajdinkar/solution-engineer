## 1. prioritize work
- **task and priority**
  - production issue, business query
  - sprint task and goals(what's critical for the release)
  - adhoc task comes - IA analysis, vulnerabilities, environment issue, QA concerns/defect
- **timezone difference** - comet team (poland), fsr(eastern tz), offshore ()
- strategies to prioritize:
  - oneNote - task, status, action-items | prioritized to-do list | revisit it every morning
  - based on urgency, dependency and impact ✔️
  - what to delegate to offshore | no one under/over utilized
  
  
| **Aspect**              | **Your Prioritization Approach**                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Clarify goals**     |                                                               |
| ✅ **Daily planning**    |  |
| ✅ **Time blocking**     | I block time on my calendar for focused work and try to group meetings to avoid frequent context switching.                                                     |
| ✅ **Communication**     | I sync regularly with offshore developers (early morning), partner teams, and architects to **unblock dependencies early**.                                         |
| ✅ **Ad-hoc issues**     | For production issues or escalations, I pause low-priority tasks and follow **triage > root cause > fix > communicate** model.                                  |
| ✅ **Review and adjust** | I re-evaluate priorities midday if something changes and communicate updates to stakeholders clearly.                                                           |

## 2. applied CAP theorem
- Can always be achieved in single region
- for distributed system, B2C
- so never applied but thought about scenarios, how my organization follow CAP. 
- being financial org, Data consistency is important
- used Aurora serverless 
- no no-SQL distributed DB, becoz of eventual consistency.
