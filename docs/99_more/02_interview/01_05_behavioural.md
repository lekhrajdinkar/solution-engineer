## ‚úîÔ∏èA. Fit for role
### 5. prioritize work
- **task and priority**
- production issue, business query
- sprint task and goals(what's critical for the release)
- adhoc task comes - IA analysis, vulnerabilities, environment issue, QA concerns/defect
- **timezone difference** - comet team (poland), fsr(eastern tz), offshore ()
- strategies to prioritize:
- oneNote - task, status, action-items | prioritized to-do list | revisit it every morning
- based on urgency, dependency and impact ‚úîÔ∏è
- what to delegate to offshore | no one under/over utilized

| **Aspect**              | **Your Prioritization Approach**                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **Clarify goals**     |                                                               |
| ‚úÖ **Daily planning**    |  |
| ‚úÖ **Time blocking**     | I block time on my calendar for focused work and try to group meetings to avoid frequent context switching.                                                     |
| ‚úÖ **Communication**     | I sync regularly with offshore developers (early morning), partner teams, and architects to **unblock dependencies early**.                                         |
| ‚úÖ **Ad-hoc issues**     | For production issues or escalations, I pause low-priority tasks and follow **triage > root cause > fix > communicate** model.                                  |
| ‚úÖ **Review and adjust** | I re-evaluate priorities midday if something changes and communicate updates to stakeholders clearly.  |
