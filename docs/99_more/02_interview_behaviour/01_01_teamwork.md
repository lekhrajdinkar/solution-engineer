## Teamwork
- Collaborate 
- working with : onshore/offshore engineer, API n/w security team, BSA, senior, different zone, business user/stakeholder, fsr/etacs, partner app (comet,casa)
- Swift alliance cloud, we start ahead and showing my approach to CASA.
- volunteer during event/s

### 0. tech talk with business
- talk / rephrase my sentence as per individual background and strength.
    - eg: sns alert with business, QA and dev

### 1. Team hard to work on
- I generally work well with most teams, but I find it difficult when working with teams that lack transparency or ownership. 
- it can create delays and confusion.
- I try to resolve it by initiating regular syncs
- and encouraging open communication.
- learned : proactively reaching out and aligning early to avoid miscommunication.

### 2.1 Conflict in team
- **ibm/mq vs MFT**
- **inbound poc** : webapp/etls as API and thread + refactoring
    - explained him, after poc we directly jump into coding, never designed the code structure.
    - is good practice to use class to organise rather in throwing multiple scripts.
    - better to readability and set context for future change
    - later on upgraded to fastapi

| **‚úîÔ∏è Situation** | I was working on a project to publish SWIFT messages to a downstream vendor, who would forward them to a transfer agent or customer agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Task**      | We needed to define how to transfer these messages from our app to an external gateway. My colleague proposed using an **MFT (Managed File Transfer)** connection, while I suggested using a **message broker** for real-time publishing.                                                                                                                               |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Action**    | Instead of pushing my approach directly, I proposed we **list pros and cons** of both options (latency, security, supportability). We involved an architect for a third opinion and aligned on key non-functional requirements.<br>Eventually, we agreed on **message broker** for real-time, reliable delivery and added a **fallback file-based solution** as backup. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Result**    | - The system became faster and more reliable.<br>- Both sides felt heard and respected.<br>- I learned that **conflicts can be healthy** if handled with open discussion, data, and empathy.                                                                                                                                                                            |

### 2.2 Conflict with manager
| **STAR Element** | **Answer**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Situation** | I was part of a large Angular upgrade project focused on front-end development ‚Äî rendering JSON responses per UX designs. After go-live, all 18 offshore back-end API developers were released.                                                                                  |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Task**      | My manager expected me to support both front-end and back-end, including batch jobs and production issues ‚Äî despite having no prior exposure to the back-end systems.                                                                                                            |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Action**    | - I respectfully explained the knowledge gap to my manager<br>- Suggested retaining a few API developers temporarily until things stabilized<br>- Documented every issue I encountered<br>- Proactively started learning key back-end flows using logs and limited system access |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Result**    | - My manager appreciated my transparency<br>- Temporary backend support was re-engaged<br>- I managed the situation without escalation<br>- Learned the value of **clarifying expectations early** and being proactive in tough situations                                       |


### 3. Deal two clients
- Approach if two clients requesting two different features?

| **Step**                      | **Approach**                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **Understand impact**       | - Talk to both clients to understand **business value**, **urgency**, and **use cases**<br>- Check if features are **blocking revenue**, **compliance**, or **key workflows** |
| ‚úÖ **Evaluate effort**         | - Estimate time, complexity, team availability, and dependencies for both requests                                                                                            |
| ‚úÖ **Communicate clearly**     | - Be transparent with both clients about **priority, ETA**, and reasoning                                                                                                     |

### 4. other responsibility
- You took something out your area of responsibility

| **STAR Element** | **Answer**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Situation** | - In my current project, our **onshore QA lead** occasionally takes extended vacations.<br>- This creates a **coordination gap** with the offshore QA team.                                                                                                              |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Task**      | - Ensure **QA continuity** and avoid impact on **release timelines** and **quality**.<br>- Fill in the gap during the QA lead‚Äôs absence.                                                                                                                                 |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Action**    | - **Voluntarily backfilled** the QA lead role<br>- Led **offshore QA coordination**, managed test cycles<br>- **Clarified requirements**, prioritized bugs<br>- Acted as a **bridge** between developers and QA team<br>- Ensured **test coverage** and sprint alignment |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Result**    | - Maintained **smooth releases** without delays<br>- Improved **cross-team collaboration**<br>- Gained **stakeholder trust**<br>- Showcased **flexibility** beyond core engineering duties                                                                               |
