## Joins ðŸŸ¢
### 1. inner
### 2. outer
- left outer
- right outer

### 3. Cross
- Results in m Ã— n rows (where m and n are row counts of each table)
- every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table
- No join condition is specified

### self join
- special case: regular join (inner, outer, cross) where a table is **joined with itself**.
- it's useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table
- Commonly used eg:
    - Employee-manager relationships
    - Bill of materials (parent-child relationships)
    - Finding duplicate records
```SQL
SELECT e.employee_name, m.employee_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
```
