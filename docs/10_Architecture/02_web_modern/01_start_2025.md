## CAP theorem
- CAP = Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
- ➡️ In a **distributed system**, you can only guarantee two of the three at any time.

| System            | Consistency | Availability | Partition Tolerance | CAP Type |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------- |
| **Kafka**         | ✅           | ❌            | ✅                   | **CP**   |
| **Aurora Global** | ❌           | ✅            | ✅                   | **AP**   |
| **DynamoDB**      | ❌ (default) | ✅            | ✅                   | **AP**   |

```
🔺 C – Consistency
    Every read gets the most recent write.
    Like a single up-to-date copy of data everywhere.
    ✅ e.g., traditional RDBMS, quorum-based systems.

🔺 A – Availability
    Every request gets a non-error response, even if it’s not the latest data.
    System remains responsive at all times.
    ✅ e.g., DynamoDB (default), DNS

🔺 P – Partition Tolerance
    System continues to operate despite network failures between nodes.
    You must tolerate partitions in any real distributed system.
    ✅ e.g., all cloud-native distributed systems (Kafka, DynamoDB, etc.)
```
